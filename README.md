# Project-Portfolio-01

## Description
A full software application (Data Visualization Web Application), a first project portfolio (3 -Member Team) for ALX students.  

## Installation
N/A

## User Story
* I want to visualize road conditions in Ghana both the number and percentages.

* I want to see representative bar and pie charts, if a user hovers on a bar, it should be selected and show the average score of roads in that region as well as the highest road score.

## Acceptance Criteria
* It is done when the Data Visualization (Landing Page) is linked to the Chart pages (Ghana road, pie).

* It is done when the user hovers around a bar or a pie chart and brings up the average score of roads and the highest road score and other relevant statistics.
* It is done when there is pie chart, bar chart, line and scatterd graph all embeded within the application and with a click on each, it fetches data out for the user to see.
